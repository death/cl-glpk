* cl-glpk

** Portability

   CL-GLPK should work on any Lisp/OS/machine combination, as long as
   CFFI, Iterate and GLPK work. Currently the LOAD-GLPK (in load.lisp)
   function is only implemented for Mac OS X, but extending it should be trivial.

   CL-GLPK has been tested on SBCL 1.0.2 / Mac OS X (10.4) / PPC

** Quick Introduction

   Load the ASDF system and eval (glpk:load-glpk). The low-level FFI
   bindings are implicitly documented by the GLPK manual. For the
   (partial) high-level API, see EXAMPLES/SAMPLE.LISP.

** License

   BSD sans advertising clause (see file COPYING)

** TODO List

*** TODO Write more examples

*** Improve error handling

    Currently error handling is done by either (error ...) or (assert ...).

*** TODO Extend High Level API

**** Make up a DSL (similar to GLPK's MPS files, but lispier)

*** TODO Complete FFI bindings
